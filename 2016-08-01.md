Ready, set, go! Today starts my personal challenge to learn and write code for the next 90 days.

Prior to a few weeks ago, I had zero coding knowledge. I recently began using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/),
but found I needed more structure and repetition to solidify what I was learning.

I am currently enrolled in the Front End Developer Blueprint at [Skillcrush](http://www.skillcrush.com) to hopefully
provide the additional structure; and to increase my consistency (and provide a little extra accountabiliy) 
I've committed to posting an excerpt of the day's lesson on GitHub for 90 days straight.

Today's Skillcrush lesson was mostly review from Codecademy but I did learn two additional skills:
+Adding the alt tag to images
